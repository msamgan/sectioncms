Minimal Design System – Design Guidelines

1. Core Principles
	•	Prioritize clarity and usability over decoration.
	•	Use whitespace intentionally to structure and declutter layouts.
	•	Establish hierarchy with typography and spacing rather than color.
	•	Maintain consistency across all UI elements.
	•	Design should feel deliberate, calm, and user-focused.

2. Color Palette
	•	Use a neutral, muted base palette with 1–2 accent colors.
	•	Background: white or very light gray.
	•	Text: dark gray or near-black.
	•	Accent: limited to one calm hue for CTAs or highlights.
	•	Avoid gradients, heavy shadows, and vibrant colors.

Suggested Minimal Color Palette:
	•	Primary Background: #FFFFFF (White)
	•	Secondary Background: #F9FAFB (Very Light Gray)
	•	Primary Text: #1F2937 (Charcoal Gray)
	•	Secondary Text: #6B7280 (Muted Gray)
	•	Accent Color: #3B82F6 (Tailwind Blue-500 – Primary Theme Color)
	•	Border/Divider: #E5E7EB (Light Gray)
	•	Disabled Elements: #D1D5DB (Soft Gray)

Note: The primary theme color across the application is Tailwind Blue-500 (#3B82F6). It should be used consistently for buttons, links, and key interactive elements to maintain visual unity.

3. Typography
	•	Use one or two complementary fonts.
	•	Establish a modular scale for font sizing.
	•	Clear hierarchy:
	•	Headings: bold, larger, spaced
	•	Body: clean, consistent line height
	•	Captions: lighter in weight and size
	•	Avoid decorative or non-functional fonts.

4. Layout and Spacing
	•	Implement a grid-based layout system.
	•	Consistent spacing units (e.g., 8px, 16px, 32px).
	•	Ensure clear vertical rhythm:
	•	Headings to content
	•	Elements within cards or sections
	•	Avoid visual congestion; allow elements to breathe.

5. Buttons
	•	Simple shapes with slight rounding.
	•	Limited to 2–3 consistent styles:
	•	Primary: solid
	•	Secondary: outlined or transparent
	•	Disabled: muted
	•	Clear visual feedback on hover and click.

6. Forms and Inputs
	•	Labels and placeholders should be legible and non-intrusive.
	•	Borders light by default; highlight on focus.
	•	Group related fields visually.
	•	Use minimal error states (text + border color change).

7. Cards and Containers
	•	Use light backgrounds or soft borders.
	•	Subtle corner rounding.
	•	Maintain internal spacing hierarchy (title, content, actions).
	•	Shadows used only for depth cues, not decoration.

8. Navigation
	•	Simplified navigation structure.
	•	Active state subtly indicated.
	•	Keep navigation accessible and consistent.
	•	On mobile, use drawer or tabbed navigation with minimal design.

9. Modals and Drawers
	•	Use a soft background overlay.
	•	Ensure clean structure with title and action area.
	•	No heavy animations; smooth open/close.
	•	Keep padding and spacing internally consistent.

10. Animations and Interactions
	•	Only subtle transitions (fade, slide, scale).
	•	Duration typically 200–300ms.
	•	Use for feedback, not for distraction.
	•	No bouncy or overly playful effects.

11. Imagery and Icons
	•	Use purposefully and sparingly.
	•	Favor line-based icons with neutral tones.
	•	Avoid using imagery for decoration only.
	•	Align images with the content tone and message.

12. Accessibility
	•	Ensure high contrast for text and interactive elements.
	•	Use semantic HTML where applicable.
	•	Enable full keyboard and screen reader support.
	•	Respect accessible tap targets and readable font sizes.

13. Tone and Content Style
	•	Language should be clear, direct, and helpful.
	•	Avoid jargon unless necessary for the audience.
	•	Keep copy short, relevant, and action-oriented.
	•	Use a consistent voice and tense throughout.
